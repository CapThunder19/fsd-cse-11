    <h2>Tanjiro Kamado</h2>
    <p>Demon Slayer: Tanjiro's Powers ExplainedTanjiro Kamado is the compassionate, determined protagonist of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba who becomes a Demon Slayer to find a cure for his sister, Nezuko, after she is turned into a demon. He possesses a red-and-green checkered haori, distinctive Hanafuda earrings, and a scar on his forehead. Trained in Water Breathing and his family's Hinokami Kagura, Tanjiro uses his heightened sense of smell and a black Nichirin sword to fight demons and seek a way to restore his sister's humanity.
